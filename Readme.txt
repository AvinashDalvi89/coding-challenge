n = 4

affected = [1,2]
posinous = [3,4]

subset is [1],[1,2],[1,2,3],[1,2,3,4],[2],[2,3],[2,3,4],[3],[3,4][4] ( total - 10)

Affected one [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4],[2,3,4] (total 3)

10-3  = 7

Out put is 7 is good subset sample


n = 5

affected = [1,2]
posionous = [3,5]

subset is [1],[1,2],[1,2,3],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4,5],[2],[2,3],[2,3,4],[2,3,4,5],[3],[3,4],[3,4,5],[4],[4,5],[5] (total - 15)

affected one [1,2,3],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5] ( total 4)

15-4 = 11

output is 11 is good subset sample
